    message: >-
      This Android mobile application seems using a symmetric algorithm, `AES`, configured weakly, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      AES keys should be at least 256 bits based on NIST recommendation.
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
        - pattern: |
            $KEY = $G.getInstance("AES");
            ...
            $KEY.initialize($BITS);
        - pattern: |
            $G $KEY = $G.getInstance("AES");
            ...
            $KEY.initialize($BITS);
      - metavariable-comparison:
          metavariable: $BITS
          comparison: $BITS < 256
