    message: >-
      This Android mobile application seems using a weak cipher, `RC4`, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      The data encrypted using `RC4` mode block could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
      It is recommended to avoid the use of `RC4`, and use `AES` instead.
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: Cipher $VAR = Cipher.getInstance("=~/(RC4\/.*\/.*|RC4)$/i", ...);
      - pattern: SecretKeyFactory $VAR = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("=~/((RC4|ARCFOUR)\/.*\/.*|(RC4|ARCFOUR))$/i", ...);
      - pattern: $VAR = Cipher.getInstance("=~/(RC4\/.*\/.*|RC4)$/i", ...);
      - pattern: $VAR = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("=~/((RC4|ARCFOUR)\/.*\/.*|(RC4|ARCFOUR))$/i", ...);
