    message: >-
      This Android mobile application seems using the insecure Blowfish cipher, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      It is recommended to use the `AES` cipher instead.
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: Cipher $VAR = Cipher.getInstance("=~/(Blowfish\/.*\/.*|Blowfish)/", ...);
      - pattern: $VAR = Cipher.getInstance("=~/(Blowfish\/.*\/.*|Blowfish)/", ...);
