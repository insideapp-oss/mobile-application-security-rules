    message: >-
      This iOS mobile application seems using a weak cipher, `RC4`, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      The data encrypted using `RC4` mode block could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
      It is recommended to avoid the use of `RC4`, and use `AES` instead.

      - pattern: kCCAlgorithmRC4
      - pattern: kCCModeRC4
