    message: >-
      This iOS mobile application seems using a weak cipher, `ECB`, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      The data encrypted using `ECB` mode block results in a lack of diffusion, which could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
      It is recommended to avoid the use of `ECB`, and use `GCM` instead.

      - pattern: kCCOptionECBMode
