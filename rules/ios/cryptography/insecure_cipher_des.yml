    message: >-
      This iOS mobile application seems using a weak cipher, `DES`, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      The data encrypted using `DES` mode block could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
      It is recommended to avoid the use of `DES`, and use `AES` instead.
