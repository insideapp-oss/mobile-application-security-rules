    message: >-
      This iOS mobile application seems using a weak cipher mode, `CBC`, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      The data encrypted using `CBC` mode block might be vulnerable to Padding Oracle attack, which could allow to retrieve its plain-text value. 
      It is recommended to avoid the use of `CBC`, and use `GCM` instead.
