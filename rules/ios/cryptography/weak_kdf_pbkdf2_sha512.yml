    message: >-
      This iOS mobile application seems using a key derivation function, `PBKDF2`, configured weakly, which could expose to various kind of vulnerabilities.
      PBKDF2 function using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm should be used with at least 600 000 iterations based on OWASP recommendation.
      Please consider implementation of algorithms recognized by Password Hashing Competition (PHC) like Argon2, for critical keys.
