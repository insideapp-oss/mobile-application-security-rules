      This iOS mobile application seems to be configured with an exportable Keychain protection, which could expose sensitive data.
      Specifically when the accessibility of the Keychain item does not contain the `ThisDeviceOnly` suffix, then the Keychain data could be
      backed up to iCloud or via iTunes even if using unencrypted backups which can be restored to any device.
      It is recommended to use an adequate protection level for Keychain data, possibly having the `ThisDeviceOnly` suffix, related with the level of confidentiality required for the stored data. 
      Note that by default the `kSecAttrAccessible` flag for Keychain is set to `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`.
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked
      - pattern: kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock
