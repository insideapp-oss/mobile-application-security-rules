      This iOS mobile application seems to be configured with a weak Keychain protection, which could expose sensitive data.
      Specifically the deprecated Keychain attributes `kSecAttrAccessibleAlways` or `kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly` could
      allow an attacker to access the data stored in the corresponding Keychain item, regardless of whether the device is locked.
      It is recommended to use an adequate protection level for Keychain data, possibly having the `ThisDeviceOnly` suffix, related with the level of confidentiality required for the stored data. 
      Note that by default the `kSecAttrAccessible` flag for Keychain is set to `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`.
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: kSecAttrAccessibleAlways
      - pattern: kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly
