      This iOS mobile application seems to be using a logger that does not provide privacy configuration, which could expose to sensitive data.
      It is recommended to use `os_log` (iOS 10+) or `Logger` (iOS 14+).
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: print
      - pattern: NSLog
      - pattern: os_signpost
